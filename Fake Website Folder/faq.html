          <div class="text-component">
            <p>There are lots of roles available, and we are particularly keen to welcome back former colleagues to help in this national effort – especially if you have experience of vaccinating in the NHS. Training requirements for this group have been slimmed down to make the application process as simple as possible.

However, you don’t need to have experience in the NHS or as a vaccinator to play a role in this programme, either in a paid or voluntary capacity, so we would encourage everyone to take a look at the roles available to see whether they might be right for them.</p>

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>We are extremely grateful to all former clinicians who have previously offered, or would now like, to come back and help support the NHS in its COVID-19 efforts.

We are keen to take up these offers as quickly as possible. Additional details are set out on our returning clinicians webpage.</p>

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>We are sorry to hear this, and want to reassure you that we are grateful for your application.

We have had a huge amount of interest in these roles and teams in all of the organisations involved in the vaccination effort are working around the clock to process the tens of thousands of expressions of interest and applications we have collectively received.

If you received a notification confirming your details have been received, you do not need to do anything else, and the organising team will be in touch as soon as possible.

However, if you have been waiting for a month or more please contact the organisation you applied through using the details on their website.</p>
