	<p style="font-family:Sans-serif">Local lockdowns are being considered by ministers as part of contingency plans to tackle rising cases of the Indian coronavirus variant.

Restrictions similar to Tier 4, which were introduced last autumn, are being reviewed, The Times reported on Monday night.

Non-essential shops, and pubs and restaurants would have to close under the measures, and people would be advised to remain at home, the newspaper said. Any businesses subjected to these restrictions would be able to apply for an £18,000 grant.

It comes as 86 local authorities now have five or more cases of the Indian variant and a total of 2,323 cases of the variant have been detected in the UK.

Boost needed in communities hesitant about vaccine, minister concedes
Cabinet minister George Eustice acknowledged the need to boost vaccine uptake in communities that were hesitant about receiving a jab.

The Environment Secretary told Sky News: "We've been doing a lot in recent months to get those communities who are a bit more hesitant to engage with this programme to have the vaccine.

"I think maybe in those areas when they see the resurgence of the virus, it may prompt them to think 'actually, this is serious, the vaccine is effective, it is preventing the spread of this in other areas so now let's get it'.

"We just need to keep redoubling our efforts in some of those hard-to-reach communities to get to see that having the vaccine for all of us is the best way out of this terrible pandemic."

He added that in "pockets where uptake is low" efforts were being made with "community leaders, faith leaders in some of those BAME (black and minority ethnic) communities to really encourage people to come forward and have the vaccine".

Local lockdowns not ruled out by minister
Cabinet minister George Eustice did not rule out the prospect of local lockdowns being imposed in response to the Indian variant.

Mr Eustice told Sky News the Government could not rule out some areas being held back as restrictions are eased elsewhere.

The Environment Secretary said ministers still wanted the planned lifting of restrictions in England on June 21 to go ahead but "we can never rule out that there may have to be a delay".

Asked whether it was possible for parts of the country to move ahead on June 21 while others are kept under restrictions, Mr Eustice said: "That would be an option and we cannot rule anything out, obviously, at this stage.

"But our preferred outcome is that we really double down and get the vaccination rates up in those areas that are seeing these problems so that we can give them the immunity that they need to this virus and then we won't have to have any such local lockdowns."

Pfizer can be stored in fridge for a month
The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine can be stored at fridge temperature for much longer than previously recommended, according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Previous advice was the vaccine needs to be kept at an ultra-low temperature, between minus 70C and minus 80C, until a few days before use when it can be transferred to a standard medical fridge.

The EMA said in a statement it had extended the approved storage period for an unopened thawed vial when kept in a fridge between 2C and 8C from five days to one month.

"The change was approved following assessment of additional stability study data submitted to EMA by the marketing authorisation holder," the agency said.

It added increased flexibility in the storage and handling of the vaccine is expected to have a "significant impact" on the planning and logistics of vaccine roll-out in EU member states.

Legal challenge over Government's PPE contracts to be heard at High Court
A legal challenge over the Government's decision to award more than £650 million in contracts for personal protective equipment (PPE) will be heard at the High Court.

The Good Law Project and EveryDoctor claim contracts awarded to PestFix, Clandeboye and Ayanda Capital were given unlawfully at the height of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in April and May 2020.

PestFix was awarded six contracts, including one worth more than £32 million for isolation suits, which the campaign groups claim involved "substantial pre-payments" and a lack of proper vetting.

The two groups claim the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has failed to provide evidence it conducted any negotiations which applied equally between prospective suppliers.

They also claim DHSC has failed to provide proper reasons for why PestFix got the contracts.
