				<h2>Scientists and doctors are concerned that a new double mutation COVID-19 variant thought to be behind a sudden surge in cases in India could be more transmissible and may even make vaccines less effective.</h2>

				<h3>Sometimes, the number of cases recorded in an area goes up simply because more people are being tested.</h3>
				<p>That doesn't seem to be the case in Hyndburn or Bolton where the number of tests over the period has remained relatively stable.</p>

				<h2>The positivity rate, which is the proportion of all tests coming back positive, in Hyndburn and Bolton has doubled over the same period to 2.7% and 4.5% respectively.</h2>

				<p>The World Health Organisation has said for the virus to be under control the proportions of tests giving a positive result should be less than 5%.</p>

				<h3>Modelling by Imperial College's COVID-19 Response Team also found there could be a "small wave" of hospital admissions and about 9,000 additional deaths by June 2022 if steps three and four of the roadmap continue as planned.</h3>
				<p>In total, there were 11,018 deaths registered in the week to 30 April - lower than usual levels. Of the total deaths, 232 were related to coronavirus - down by 58 on the previous week. This is the lowest since September last year when 234 deaths involving coronavirus were registered.</p>

					<h3>Scientists advised that going back into step three from step four could be "an option to counter the emergence of variants of concern, at least temporarily until booster vaccines are distributed".</h3>

					<p>Imperial revised the number of predicted deaths from COVID-19 down from previous reports as new data shows transmission from vaccinated people who still get infected is nearly 50% lower than from unvaccinated people.</p>
